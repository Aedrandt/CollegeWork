""" This file is an example of how Functional Programming and Object Oriented Programming Works """

## Functional Programming
# Using map() to multiply each element in a list by 2
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def multiply_by_two(x):
    """a function for multiplying a number by two"""
    return x * 2

doubled_numbers = list(map(multiply_by_two, numbers))
print(doubled_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


## Object Oriented Programming
# Creating a Human class
class Human:
    """a class to make an object called Human"""
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        """the attributes of the 'Human' object"""
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        """a method for the object 'Human' to print an output"""
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old.")

# Creating a Human object
person = Human("Ahdan", 19)

# Calling the say_hello() method on the Human object
person.say_hello() # Output: Hello, my name is Ahdan and I am 19 years old.
